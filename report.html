        The group members are Michael Mafeni (mm17291) and Ainesh Sevellaraja (as17284). Our site is a booking site for futuristic space travel.
        The login for the site is JohnS@hotmail.co.uk with password H3LL0W0RLD. This also serves as an administrator account.
        A non-administrator login for the site is AshleyA@gmail.com with password Duck15. There is also a register page if you do not wish to use these login credentials.
        To run simply enter "node server.js" in your terminal and it will run on localhost on both port 3000 (HTTPS), and port 8080 (HTTP) (which gets redirected to the HTTPS port).
        A valid ticket combination is as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Origin Base = USA</li>
            <li>Destination Base = Mars Colony One</li>
            <li>Leaving Date = 22nd June 2020</li>
            <li>Return Date = 26th June 2020</li>
        </ul>
        Below are what we feel are the estimates for our grades:
        <ul>
            <li>A for HTML</li>
            <li>A for CSS</li>
            <li>A for JS</li>
            <li>A for PNG</li>
            <li>A for SVG</li>
            <li>A for Server</li>
            <li>A for Database</li>
            <li>A for Dynamic pages</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>HTML - A</h1>
            We have created a robust site using the handlebars framework to help generate html in order to make our pages dynamic.
            We deliver pages using XHTML delivery and have the following pages:
            <ol>
                <li>Main Page : This page contains an about us section and a booking bar to book destinations</li>
                <li>Booking page: When a user has entered in their details through the booking bar. All the tickets matching the following criteria would be shown on this page.
                    There would also be a link to a confirmation page.</li>
                <li>Account Page: On this page the user can view / alter their details as well as view all purchased tickets. They can also delete their account if possible</li>
                <li>Add Tickets (Admin only): Here an Admin can add tickets and destinations </li>
                <li>Edit Tickets (Admin only): Here an Admin can edit and delete tickets</li>
            </ol>
            We also used made use of handlebars partial tool to reuse html e.g the navigation bar, the login form, etc.

        <h1>CSS - A</h1>
        All of our styling was done using stylesheets and we made sure to make our design consistent throughout.
        We made our own stylesheets and also made use of a stylesheet from <a href="https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html">materialize</a>.
        We used various SVG icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/">fontawesome.com</a>, especially in the tickets.
        For the fonts, we used two Google Fonts, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous">Righteous</a> for the logo and some headers,
        and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik">Rubik</a> as the main font.
        Media Queries were used to make the web pages responsive and using the tools offered by our browser, our website renders well on most mobile devices.
        We also added simple animation using transitions to several elements such as the mobile navigation bar and the booking summary.
        We used vendor prefixes for these transitions to ensure that they function cross-browser.

        <h1>Javascript - A</h1>
        We used strict Javascript on both the client and server side.
        JQuery was used to help produce client-side scripts.
        Javascript was used to trigger our animations as well as change the styling and content of an HTML block when necessary.
        Ajax was used to make client-side http requests to the server.

        <h1>PNG - A</h1>
        GIMP was used to produce images. The space image was gotten from <a href="https://wallpaperaccess.com/stars">wallpaperaccess.com</a> while the rocket pictures (<a href="public/assets/spaceX_ship.png">1</a> and <a href="public/assets/spaceX_ship_moon.png">2</a>) were downloaded from the SpaceX website.
        The <a href="public/assets/mars.png">Martian landscape</a> used in the About Us section was made using GIMP and a combination of tools. A picture of a <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pZ-XFIrJMtE">desert</a> served as the basis.
        First the sky was removed and replaced with a <a href="public/assets/cloudless_sky.jpg">cloudless sky</a> (source: <a href="https://jooinn.com/">jooinn.com</a>) whose colour was changed by adding a layer of brown onto it.
        The <a href="public/assets/rover.jpg">mars rover</a> (source: <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/">NASA</a>) was cut, placed in another layer and scaled down.
        Finally the erase and paintbrush tools were used to smoothen rough edges.

        Another <a href="public/assets/landscape_blur.png">terrain image</a> was created but not used. This was created by changing the colours of the grass and sky of this<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/-SO3JtE3gZo">landscape</a> to blue and purple respectively.
        A <a href="public/assets/space_probe.jpeg">satelite</a> (Source: <a href="https://africangeospace.com/">africangeospace</a>) was then cropped out, blurred, scaled and pasted onto another layer to form the image.
        <h1>SVG - A</h1>
            We utilised an SVG rocket image from <a href="https://iconmonstr.com/rocket-19-svg/">iconmonstr.com</a> which we used as Astra's icon (favicon_black.png).
            We used Inkscape to combine this rocket with the Google Font Righteous to create the logo (logo_white_embedded.svg).
            To do this we edited the rocket's path using Inkscape's path-editing tool to wrap its trail around the text.
            We decided to embed the font inside the SVG file so that it can be used as a standalone image.
            We also used this tool to create a horizontal rocket with a straight trail used in the tickets (sideways_rocket.svg).
            Furthermore, we animated this horizontal rocket, making it fly from left to right (sideways_rocket_animated.svg). The rocket body
            was animated using a translation transformation, whereas the trail was animated using by shifting
            nodes in the path. To make animating easier, we edited the trail's path to remove bezier curves that
            were present as they were not necessary for the horizontal trail.

        <h1>Server - A</h1>
            We used the ExpressJS framework, with several add-ons for our server. We are utilising two ports: port 3000 for HTTPS requests and port 8080 for HTTP requests.
            All HTTP requests are redirected to the equivalent HTTPS request.
            For the HTTPS server, we are using a self-signed certificate (server.cert and server.key).
            We have used the express-session add-on to save the user's session so that they remain logged in when they next visit our website. Sessions also keep track of whether the user is an administrator or not.
            Our server uses Express' routers when handling sub-pages of the Account and Admin sections of our website. The server (server.js) delegates requests to these sections to account.js and admin.js respectively, which then process these requests.
            We have also made the server handle case-sensitive URLs.
            URL Validation was done and tested in a separate file called get.js.
            For each request made to the server, we are specifying the character set as UTF-8 before delivering the page.
            Our server also specifies the content-type using content negotiation. The content-type is set to XHTMl if the browser understands it, and to HTML otherwise.

        <h1>Database - A</h1>
            For our website we created an SQLite database, embedded in astra.db. The database has the following tables:
            <ol>
                <li>User: Stores the details of every user. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt</li>
                <li>Ticket: Stores the details of every ticket </li>
                <li>User_Ticket: Stores every User-Ticket pair that exists, that is when a user has a particular ticket</li>
                <li>Destination: Stores every possible destination a ticket can have</li>
            </ol>
            Our database schema is depicted in <a href="create_db.sql">create_db.sql</a>. We made use of constraints to ensure data entered is valid.
            We perform Insert, Update, Delete and Select operations on our database.

        <h1>Dynamic pages - A</h1>
            We implemented multiple dynamic pages in our website. For these pages, the server obtains relevant data from the database and inserts them into page templates before delivering.
            We also used booleans to change contents of elements, such as changing the navigation bar when the user is logged in.
            Furthermore, we incorporated prompts to indicate whether a user's action was successful or not, by displaying a banner at the top of the page containing a message regarding the outcome. This message changes according on the user's action.
